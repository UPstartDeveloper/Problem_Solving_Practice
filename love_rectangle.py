Solving the following problem from Interview Cake:
https://www.interviewcake.com/question/python/rectangular-love
"""

"""
1. Restate the problem:
Ok, so you want me to find the overlap between these two rectangles, correct?

2. Clarifying Questions:
Alright, so I see in the example given that the rectangles are in the upper
    right corner of the Cartesian plane. Will the values for the 'left_x' and
    'bottom_y' keys always be positive? Or can these rectangles sometimes go
    into the other corners of the Cartesian plane?

What shall be returned if there is no intersection between the two rectangles?
    Would just an empty dict() object (e.g. {}) suffice?
