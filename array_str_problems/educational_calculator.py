"""
You are building an educational website and want to create a simple calculator. 
The calculator will only allow addition and subtraction of positive integers.

Given an expression string using the "+" and "-" operators like "5+16-2", 
write a function to find the total.

Sample input/output:

calculate("6+9-12") => 3
calculate("1+2-3+4-5+6-7") => -2
calculate("255") => 255

Assumptions:
positive integers
only +/-
input -> 1 string
output -> int
can NOT assume there's at least one operation
will Assume there's at least one operand
will not make assumptions about the sizes of operands 
no spaces
there may be commas ---> replace w/ "_"

int("1_000") = 1000 âœ…
int("1,000") = 1000 ðŸš©


Brainstorming:

1. Iterating left to right, no space:
- init the operator to addition
- iterate over till you hit the next operator (or go out of bound)
    - update the result
    - update the operator
    - move on, 
- return the result


2. Iterating right to left
iterate until you hit an operator, 
    - push the operand and the operator onto a stack
    - push the last operand on w/ a plus

- pop everything from the stack, compute the result
- return the value

Intuition:
- an operand is something that's fenced in by two non-numerical symbols

Approach:
# Base Case:
    # no more expression
    # return the result
# Recursive Case:
    # pick up the next operand, 
    # updates the overall result (default is +)

calculate("1+2-3+4-5+6-7") => -2

expr                operand        operator     result
"1+2-3+4-5+6-7"         1               +        0, 1
"2-3+4-5+6-7"          2               +        1, 3
"-3+4-5+6-7"            3               -        3, 0
"+4-5+6-7"              4               +        0, 4
"-7"                    7               -        5, -2
""                    N/A             N/A        -2

3. Using Two Operands Always

# A) init the result to 0 (will always be our first operand)
# B) init the operator based on if the first char (if not -, then +)
# C) iterate
    # get to the next operator sign (or the end)
    # take the 2nd operand (between operators, or from the beginning if first operation is addition)
    # do the operation(result, second_operand, operator), update result
    # update position of first operator
# D) return result
