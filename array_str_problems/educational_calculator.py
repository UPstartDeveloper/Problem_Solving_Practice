"""
You are building an educational website and want to create a simple calculator. 
The calculator will only allow addition and subtraction of positive integers.

Given an expression string using the "+" and "-" operators like "5+16-2", 
write a function to find the total.

Sample input/output:

calculate("6+9-12") => 3
calculate("1+2-3+4-5+6-7") => -2
calculate("255") => 255

Assumptions:
positive integers
only +/-
input -> 1 string
output -> int
can NOT assume there's at least one operation
will Assume there's at least one operand
will not make assumptions about the sizes of operands 
no spaces
there may be commas ---> replace w/ "_"

int("1_000") = 1000 âœ…
int("1,000") = 1000 ðŸš©


Brainstorming:

Intuition:
- an operand is something that's fenced in by two non-numerical symbols

Approach:
# Base Case:
    # no more expression
    # return the result
# Recursive Case:
    # pick up the next operand, 
    # updates the overall result (default is +)

calculate("1+2-3+4-5+6-7") => -2
