In class work:

Coding Conventions
1. Python: after else, put a comment saying the condition I know must be True
if x > 4:
    do_something()
else: # x <= 4
    do_something_else()

2. Python 3, you can put an => saying what the return value in a function is
    def __add__(self, other: 'Position') -> 'Position':

3. Java: using camelCase

4. Indentation: when you make {} that's longer than one
    for {
        hjgjjg
    }
5. semantic variable, argument (and file) names
    - it should say "what it is"
    - coefficient is k
    - string is str
    - array -> arr
    - Linked List -> ll

6. Python: line length less than 80 characters

7. Whitespace between functions:
    2 if not in a class, 1 if in a class

8. Leave one blank line at the end of a Python script

9. Python: use TitleCase in naming classes

10. HTML: indent nested tags

11. HTML: declare document type at top of file
<!DOCTYPE html>

12. Big O - clearly


FizzBuzz errors:
    1. not using camelCase in function name,
    2. not using else if
    3. missing semi colon
    4. unnecessary semi colon in for loop
    5. not camelCase in targetnum
    6. Needs to use &&, not &
    7. Mixing ES6 and non ES6 syntax (var, let)
