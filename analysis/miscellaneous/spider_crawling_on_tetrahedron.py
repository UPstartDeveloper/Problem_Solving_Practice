    Suppose a spider is crawling along the edges of a tetrahedron 
    with sides ABCD and edges of length 1. 

    Shown below as an undirected graph"

    A -------------- B
    | \          /   |
    |      /  \      |
    | /            \ |
    C -------------- D
         
    
    You can assume:
        the spider starts at point A on the tetrahedron  
        at each vertex chooses its next edge at random 
            (so it has a 1/3 chance of going back along the edge it came on, 
            and a 1/3 chance of going along each of the other two).

    Given this information, find the probability that:
        after it has crawled a distance of 5, 
        it is again at point A.

    Input/Problem:
        adj. list - undirected connected graph
        immutable

    Output:
        let n = distance the spider crawls
        given n = 5, what is:
            (number of unique paths starting w/ A, that end with A) / 
            (total number of unique paths starting w/ A) ?
    
    Intuition:
        Math reasoning - b/c all paths are weighed with equal proba:
            distance   |       # paths starting with A    |   # paths starting/ending w/ A  
                n      |          total = pow(3, n - 1)   |         end = total_prev - end_prev

                3                        9                              3
                4                       27                              6
    GUESS:      5                       81? âœ…                          9? --> why is it 21?
